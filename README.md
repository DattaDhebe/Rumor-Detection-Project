  Microblogging platforms like Twitter serves as an ideal place for fabricating and
diffusing rumours. These rumours disseminate at a rapid pace and lead to
grievous social issues. Rumours can cause social panic and adversely affect
people and organizations. Therefore, detecting rumours accurately, quickly and
automatically is important. Existing models detect rumours on social media sites
by employing feature extraction which is time-consuming, biased and labour-
intensive. Recent work uses machine learning based techniques to detect
rumours automatically but early detection of rumours continues to be an
obstacle. The proposed system employs a deep learning model, Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) in collaboration with pooling function of Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to quickly detect rumour. LSTM networks makes predictions
based on time series data. It also overcomes problems faced while training
traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), like, exploding and vanishing
gradient. Using forwarding contents, this system detect rumour.
